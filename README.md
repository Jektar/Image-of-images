# Image-of-images
A program that makes images out of smaller images

To use the code, place the python file in a folder with another folder called smallImages containing png files of the smaller images
Secondly, get a png file called mainImage into the folder with the python file. 
Run the code
You can adjust things like default size of the small images (baseSize), how far apart small images are (smallImScale) and quality of the image by changing
their respective initial values. You can find all of them at the bottom of the code.

After running the code, you should find a png file called finalImg in the folder. This is the main image represented by smaller images.

The result should look something like the example I created.
